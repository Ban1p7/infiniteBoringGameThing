<h1>Infinite Boring Game Thing</h1>

<h3>This is a 3d infinite game where you use the arrow keys to dodge bad things and get good things. I'd say about 25% of mobile games are variants of this exact same concept, but luckily, this isn't those games. This was 100% made by me. Except the sound effects and font</h3>
<h6>I used three.js to make this project, which I found was incredibly easy to use. I hope to add more textures to things in the future, now that I've found a good stackoverflow page-- I mean figured out how to do that.</h6>
